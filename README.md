**NOT DEAD**
I'm just rewriting it for a while

# Archstall
Simple Arch Linux installer.

*10/10 best Arch installer ever* - Linus Torvalds maybe

*what is archstall and why are you in my house* - Judd Vinet perhaps 

## Usage
To use the script, run 

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/JtoeR -o archstall
bash archstall [-h]
```

from a booted Arch live environment. Follow the instructions and you're golden.

## why
Well I don't like other Arch installers so I just made this.

## development
*"what do you mean development this is literally just a script-"* shshshshut, shut up. If you want to help with this, feel free to slap on a PR. I tested this many times in a VM, but there still might be some bugs. Opening an issue helps a lot!
