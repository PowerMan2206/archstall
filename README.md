# Archstall
Simple Arch Linux installer.

## Usage
To use the script, run 

```
curl -L https://git.io/JtoeR > archstall
bash archstall
```

from a booted Arch live environment. Follow the instructions and you're golden.

## why
Well I don't like other Arch installers so I just made this.

## development
*"what do you mean development this is literally just two scripts-"* shshshshut, shut up. If you want to help with this, feel free to slap on a PR. I tested this many times in a VM, but there still might be some bugs. Opening an issue helps a lot!
