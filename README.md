# Archstall
Simple Arch Linux installer.

*10/10 best Arch installer ever* - Linus Torvalds maybe

*what is archstall and why are you in my house* - Judd Vinet perhaps 

*Now it's even harder, better, faster, and stronger!* - me

## Usage
To use the script, run 

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/JtoeR -o archstall
bash archstall
```

from an Arch live environment. Follow the instructions and you're golden.

### why
Well I don't like other Arch installers so I just made this.

### development
*"what do you mean development this is just a scrip-"* shshshshut, shut up. If you want to help with this, feel free to slap on a PR. I tested this countless times in a VM, but there still might be some bugs. Opening an issue helps

also **no** I didn't copy archinstall's name, I did this first
