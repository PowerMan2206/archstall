# Archstall
Simple Arch Linux installer.

*10/10 best Arch installer ever* - Linus Torvalds maybe

*i give archstall a 21 out of 20, very slick!* - Frog guy

*what is archstall and why are you in my house* - Judd Vinet perhaps 

*Now it's even harder, better, faster, and stronger!* - me

## Usage
To use the script, run 

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/JtoeR -o archstall
bash archstall
```

from an Arch live environment. Follow the instructions and you're golden.

## Features(?)
- **only compatible with UEFI systems**
- uses rEFInd as the bootloader
- both automatic *(nukes the disk and repartitions)* and manual *(select yourself)* partitioning
- package customization
- timezone, a network manager, root password, user, AUR helper, microcode, the whole pajazz
- like 1 (one) filesystem
- better than archinstall frfr
 
### why
Well I don't like other Arch installers so I just made this.

### development
*"what do you mean development this is just a scrip-"* shshshshut, shut up. If you want to help with this, feel free to slap on a PR. I tested this countless times in a VM, but there still might be some bugs. Opening an issue also helps.

also **no** I didn't copy archinstall's name, I did this first
